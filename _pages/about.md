I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Concordia University in Montréal, Canada, 
supervised by Prof. Chunjiang An and Prof. Catherine Mulligan. My research focuses on contaminant fate and transport 
in shoreline and subsurface systems, with an emphasis on multiphase flow, microbial biodegradation, and pollutant 
migration and retention in porous media under hydrodynamic and climate stressors. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

I am particularly interested in developing nature-inspired, sustainable remediation technologies to protect coastal 
environments from spilled oil. My work includes bio-based hydrogel coatings for shoreline substrates, eco-friendly 
surface washing agents, and responsive separation processes that promote oil removal while supporting in situ 
biodegradation and ecosystem recovery. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

So far, I have published 11 first-author journal papers and 26 peer-reviewed publications in total in journals such as 
ACS ES&T Water, Journal of Hazardous Materials, Environmental Science: Nano, Science of the Total Environment, and 
Journal of Environmental Management, along with 10 conference papers. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
My research has also been highlighted by Concordia University, IAGLR Lakes Letter, Envirobites, AZoNano, and other 
science outreach platforms.

I am honoured to be a recipient of the Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship and the FRQNT Doctoral Research Scholarship, 
as well as multiple competitive awards including the International Oil Spill Conference 2024 Scholarship and Concordia 
graduate scholarships. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
Beyond research, I enjoy teaching and mentoring: I have served as teaching assistant for three courses and as a lab 
instructor training over ten students on experimental techniques and analytical instruments. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## About in Chinese / 个人简介（中文）

我目前是加拿大蒙特利尔康考迪亚大学土木与环境工程专业的四年级博士生，导师为 **Dr. Chunjiang An** 和 
**Dr. Catherine Mulligan**。我的研究围绕 **岸线和地下多相污染物的迁移转化**，重点关注多相流、微生物生物降解、
以及在水动力与气候胁迫下污染物在多孔介质中的迁移与滞留行为。:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

我致力于发展 **自然启发的绿色修复技术** 来保护海岸环境免受溢油影响，包括：面向岸线基质的生物基水凝胶涂层、
环境友好的表面洗脱剂、以及基于界面润湿性和微乳体系的可响应分离工艺，这些方法既促进油污高效去除，也支持原位
微生物降解和生态系统恢复。:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

到目前为止，我以第一作者发表了 11 篇期刊论文，共发表 26 篇同行评议论文和 10 篇会议论文，期刊包括 
**ACS ES&T Water、Journal of Hazardous Materials、Environmental Science: Nano、Science of the Total Environment、Journal of Environmental Management** 等。:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
我的研究工作多次被 Concordia News、IAGLR Lakes Letter、Envirobites、AZoNano 等平台报道。:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

我曾获 **Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship**、**FRQNT Doctoral Research Scholarship** 等具有竞争力的奖学金，
并多次获得会议资助和院系奖项。在教学与指导方面，我担任过 3 门课程的助教和实验室指导老师，培训十余名学生使用
GC-MS、GC-FID、UV-Vis、LISST 等仪器，并指导硕士生完成溢油处理相关课题研究。:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
