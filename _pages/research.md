My research lies at the intersection of contaminant transport, shoreline oil spill response, and sustainable remediation 
technologies. I work with multiphase flow experiments, bio-based functional materials, and pilot-scale shoreline tank 
systems to understand and mitigate the environmental impacts of spilled oil.

Below are some of my main research areas:

- **Bio-based hydrogel coatings for shoreline oil spill mitigation**  
- **Green and responsive surface washing agents for oiled shorelines**  
- **Oil transport and translocation in shoreline and subsurface systems**  
- **Microplastics and oil–particle interactions in coastal environments** :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

You can find selected projects with more details below.
