I have worked extensively on the development and evaluation of eco-friendly surface washing agents for shoreline cleanup, 
including nonionic surfactant-modified nanoclay systems, glycoprotein-based washing fluids, and dual-responsive agents 
that can be triggered by pH or ionic strength. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

Key contributions include:

- A framework for evaluating and selecting shoreline surface washing agents based on performance, toxicity, and operational 
  factors (*Journal of Environmental Management*, 2021); :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}
- A dual-responsive nanoclay/sodium alginate washing agent enabling efficient oil removal and reusability;
- A pH-responsive phosphoprotein washing fluid with demonstrated oil removal performance and biotoxicity assessment;
- Glycoprotein-assisted washing fluids for restoring oiled shorelines while maintaining environmental integrity. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}

**中文简介**

本研究方向针对传统表面洗脱剂毒性高、环境风险大的问题，设计了多种 **绿色、可响应的表面洗脱体系**，包括非离子
表面活性剂改性纳米黏土、糖蛋白洗脱液、以及 pH / 离子强度双响应的复合洗脱剂。研究从去油效率、环境毒性、操作
条件等方面提出了一套系统的评估与筛选框架，为岸线溢油应急中绿色药剂的选择提供技术支撑。:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}
