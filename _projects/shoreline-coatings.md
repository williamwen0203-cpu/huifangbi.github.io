title: "Bio-based Hydrogel Coatings for Shoreline Oil Spill Mitigation"
description: "Developing alginate- and cellulose nanocrystal-based coatings to prevent shoreline oiling and enhance in situ biodegradation."

We developed bio-based hydrogel coatings based on calcium alginate and cellulose nanocrystals that can be applied to 
shoreline substrates to reduce the impact of oil spills. These coatings tune surface wettability to be strongly hydrophilic, 
so that oil does not readily adhere to the coated surface and instead remains on the water, where it can be more easily 
recovered. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

Laboratory and pilot-scale tank experiments demonstrate that the coatings:

- Decrease oil adhesion and penetration into porous shoreline materials;
- Facilitate subsequent oil removal using low-toxicity washing agents;
- Provide controlled nutrient release to stimulate indigenous oil-degrading bacteria and enhance biodegradation. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

This work is summarized in recent publications in *Journal of Hazardous Materials* and *ACS ES&T Water* on bio-based 
coatings, oil transport behavior, and biodegradation dynamics.
