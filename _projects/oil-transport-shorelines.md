Through participation in multiple Multi-Partner Research Initiative (MPRI) projects funded by Natural Resources Canada and 
Fisheries and Oceans Canada, I have contributed to understanding how oil infiltrates, migrates, and is retained in shoreline 
and subsurface environments. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}

Representative studies include:

- Vertical infiltration of spilled oil in soils impacted by root netting and rainfall (*Journal of Environmental Engineering*); :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}
- Oil translocation pathways and processes in Canadian shoreline environments (MPRI technical reports);
- Resuspension and transformation of stranded oil and formation of oil–particle aggregates in intertidal zones (*Journal of Hazardous Materials*). :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}

These insights help improve shoreline spill response strategies, including when and where to deploy coatings, washing agents, 
or other countermeasures.

**中文简介**

在加拿大多方合作的 MPRI 项目中，我系统研究了 **溢油在岸线与地下介质中的垂向入渗、迁移与再悬浮过程**，包括根系
网络和降雨对油垂向迁移的影响、岸线环境中油–颗粒聚集体的形成机理，以及不同岸线类型下油的转移路径与滞留特征。相关
成果以技术报告与期刊论文形式发表，为制定更精细化、因地制宜的岸线溢油响应策略提供了数据与机理支持。:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}
